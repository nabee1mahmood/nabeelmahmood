                        <h2>Natural Language Processing Discord Bot</h2>
                        <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dataset:</strong>
                                <p>Used a Shakespeare dataset provided by the course as training data for the language model.</p>
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong>
                                <p>Text was tokenized by splitting on spaces, converting to lowercase, and removing punctuation for consistency.</p>
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li><strong>Language Model:</strong>
                                <p>Built unigram, bigram, and trigram frequency tables using dictionaries. Bigram probabilities were smoothed using Laplace smoothing, and trigram predictions used backoff when needed.</p>
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li><strong>Prediction:</strong>
                                <p>The bot generates 10 words to complete a user's input using both bigram and trigram models. It also calculates and displays the log probability of each generated sentence.</p>
                            </li>
                            <br />
                            <li><strong>Bot Setup:</strong>
                                <p> The bot listens for messages and responds with sentence completions in real time.</p>
                            </li>

       <h2>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h2>
<p><strong>Key Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Dataset:</strong>
        <p>The dataset was loaded from a CSV file using pandas and was from Kaggle .</p>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong>
        <p>Missing values were handled by either filling or removing them, and feature scaling was applied using both Min-Max scaling and Z-score normalization.</p>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Model Building:</strong>
        <p>A Logistic Regression model was trained to classify transactions as either fraudulent or not. The goal was to build a reliable binary classification system.</p>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong>
        <p>The model performed well, with strong results across all metrics â€” 98.02% precision, 98.00% recall, 98.00% accuracy, and a 98.00% F1-score.</p>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
        <p>Logistic Regression provided a simple and effective approach to detecting fraud, balancing accuracy with ease of implementation.</p>
    </li>
