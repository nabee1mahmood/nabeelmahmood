Was assigned the lead on the Paint Oven Project to integrate 
real-time data from a paint oven into ThingWorx, 
capturing crucial metrics such as relative humidity 
(maintained at optimal levels between 40-60% for paint curing), temperature 
(controlled within a range of 70-90Â°F for efficient curing and quality), and oven run time 
(monitored and optimized to reduce energy consumption by 20%).
Created real-time IoT dashboards using ThingWorx and JavaScript which 
contribute to data-driven decision-making and 
process optimization efforts within the organization.
